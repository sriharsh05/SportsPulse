# Sports Pulse

This sports application is developed using React.js and TypeScript along with TailwindCSS through Vite. The app caters to two primary user roles: guests and sports enthusiasts. Guests have access to view live sports and articles fetched by the application. Meanwhile, sports enthusiasts have the added functionality of selecting preferences of their interests. Its use of Swagger API documentation ensures an efficient data retrieval system, making it a comprehensive solution for staying updated and informed in the world of sports.
